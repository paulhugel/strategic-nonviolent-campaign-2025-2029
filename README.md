## Exploratory Hypothesis Framework

All hypotheses, research design, and analytic protocols are preregistered and permanently archived via OSF.  
For full hypothesis statements, methodologies, and transparency declarations, consult the OSF record and linked components.

### Hypothesis Pillars

1. **Civil Resistance**
2. **Electoral Defense**
3. **Institutional Safeguards**
4. **Narrative & Media Framing**
5. **International Solidarity**

Each pillar has a focused, testable hypothesis and is associated with a public OSF component for replication and peer review.
